REQUIRES: Community Core Library v0.14.1 or later!

This mod overhauls wardens, prisoners and slaves.

New game mechanics include...
...Slaves!  Turn those prisoners into slaves.  Don't worry about what they can and can't do, they are slaves, make them do anything you like (except warden)!
...Room Markers - Use a simple sign or a security camera to mark a room as allowed for prisoners and/or slaves.  Be careful about allowing your slaves outside, they may run if they think they can get away.
...Restricted Doors - Doors have restriction options now.  You can set them all individually; ownership overrides any other restriction settings however, locking doors trumps all.  Some pawns can ignore restrictions (See the MCM for details).
...Security Stations &amp; Remote Monitoring - Wardens can keep an eye on your prisoners, slaves, as well as anything and anyone hostile to you at security stations through security cameras.
...Restraints - Slap handcuffs on your prisoners to restrict their ability to manipulate things, put shackles on slaves to slow them down and make them less likely to run off.

Be sure to make a prison yard to keep your prisoners from going bonkers.  Slaves need free time to unwind too - at least it's fairly easy to keep them happy though, maybe give them a TV room.

This mod is based on the 'Prison Improvements' mod by Wastelander.
