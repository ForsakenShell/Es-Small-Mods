A small mod to add a few prisoner improvements:

A cell door which prisoners as well as colonists can open. Used to create prisoner bedrooms (among other things).

A security camera under Misc, which marks a room as a prison without using beds. Can be named.

Prisoners with cabin fever will automatically attempt to find an open prison space to relieve the cabin fever. An open space is a room with at least 64 open sky tiles.

A few changes to the warden behavior so that, for example, wardens will stop hauling prisoners that leave their bedrooms but who stay within the prison.

Prisoners can be transferred to any named security camera.

The ability to enslave prisoners by crafting a slave collar at a tailor's workshop.
